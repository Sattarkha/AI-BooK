## Prompt

Create a complete AI-Native textbook project for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Hackathon (Panaversity 2025) using Spec-Driven Development, Docusaurus, Claude Code, and Spec-Kit Plus. Define the foundational constitution for this book project, guiding all future requirements, specifications, architecture, and implementation. This constitution establishes purpose, audience, constraints, tone, scope, and success criteria.

## Response snapshot

Created the foundational constitution document (.specify/memory/constitution.md) for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — An AI-Native Textbook" project. The constitution includes:

- Project identity and mission
- Core purpose for the AI-native textbook on humanoid robotics
- Target audience (Panaversity, PIAIC, GIAIC students)
- Book vision as a structured, university-level course textbook
- Project constraints (Docusaurus + GitHub Pages, RAG chatbot integration)
- Tone & style guidelines (academically rigorous, accessible)
- Comprehensive scope covering ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA systems, etc.
- Success criteria including chapters, diagrams, code samples, exercises
- Technical architecture principles
- Content standards and maintenance guidelines
- Ethical guidelines for responsible AI

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational constitution document that will guide all future development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation task)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with comprehensive project constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with requirements gathering and specification creation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution establishes clear boundaries and direction for the textbook project

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin requirements specification based on constitution
