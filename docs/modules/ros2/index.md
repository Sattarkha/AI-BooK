# Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the ROS 2 module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Overview

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to be more robust, secure, and scalable than its predecessor. It provides a collection of libraries and tools that help software developers create robot applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Build basic robotic applications with ROS 2

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. [ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services](./nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication concepts
2. [Python Integration with ROS 2](./python-integration.md) - Using rclpy for Python development
3. [URDF for Humanoid Robots](./urdf.md) - Robot description and modeling

## Hardware Requirements

For hands-on practice with this module, you will need:
- A computer running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar Linux distribution
- Python 3.8 or higher
- At least 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended)
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed

## Getting Started

Begin with the first section to learn about the fundamental ROS 2 concepts that form the backbone of robotic applications.
