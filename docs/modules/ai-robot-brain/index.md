# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers NVIDIA Isaac platform for AI perception and navigation in robotics.

## Overview

The NVIDIA Isaac platform provides a comprehensive solution for developing AI-powered robotic applications. It includes Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for perception and navigation, and tools for developing cognitive capabilities in robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data
- Implement Isaac ROS for Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Configure Nav2 path planning for bipedal humanoids
- Develop perception pipelines using Isaac's AI capabilities
- Integrate AI models for robot decision making and navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
- Knowledge of ROS 2 (covered in previous module)
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (covered in Digital Twin module)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. [Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim.md) - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data
2. [Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros.md) - VSLAM and navigation systems
3. [Nav2 Path Planning](./nav2-planning.md) - Navigation for humanoid robots

## Hardware Requirements

For hands-on practice with this module, you will need:
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3060 or better recommended)
- At least 16GB of RAM (32GB recommended)
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim installed
- Isaac ROS packages installed

## Getting Started

Begin with Isaac Sim to understand how photorealistic simulation can accelerate robot development.
