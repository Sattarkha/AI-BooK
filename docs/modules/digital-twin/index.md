# Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers simulation environments that serve as digital twins for robotic systems.

## Overview

Digital twin technology creates virtual replicas of physical robotic systems. In robotics, simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity allow us to test, validate, and develop robotic applications in a safe, controlled, and cost-effective environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of physics simulation for robotics
- Configure Gazebo for robot simulation with accurate physics
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Create high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Validate robotic algorithms in simulation before real-world deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Knowledge of basic physics concepts (gravity, collisions, forces)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in previous module)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. [Gazebo Simulation](./gazebo-simulation.md) - Physics simulation and robot modeling
2. [Unity Integration](./unity-integration.md) - High-fidelity rendering and interaction
3. [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md) - Simulating real sensors in virtual environments

## Hardware Requirements

For hands-on practice with this module, you will need:
- A computer with GPU support (NVIDIA recommended)
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows 10/11
- Gazebo Garden or Fortress installed
- Unity Hub with Unity 2022.3 LTS installed

## Getting Started

Begin with the Gazebo simulation section to understand the fundamentals of physics-based robot simulation.
