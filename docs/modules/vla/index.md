# Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers multimodal AI systems that integrate vision, language, and action for intelligent robot behavior.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action systems represent the cutting edge of embodied AI, where robots can perceive their environment visually, understand natural language commands, and execute appropriate actions. This module explores how modern AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), can be integrated with robotic systems to create conversational and cognitive robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper
- Design cognitive planning systems that translate commands to ROS actions
- Integrate LLMs for conversational robotics
- Build multimodal perception-action loops
- Create autonomous humanoid robots capable of performing complex tasks

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of ROS 2 (covered in previous modules)
- Basic knowledge of AI and machine learning
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of sensor integration (covered in Digital Twin module)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. [Voice-to-Action](./voice-action.md) - Converting speech to robotic actions
2. [Cognitive Planning](./cognitive-planning.md) - LLMs translating commands to actions
3. [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](./capstone-project.md) - Building a complete system

## Hardware Requirements

For hands-on practice with this module, you will need:
- Computer with sufficient GPU resources for running AI models
- Microphone for voice input
- At least 16GB of RAM (32GB recommended for full AI model performance)
- Access to OpenAI API or similar LLM service
- Robot simulation environment (Gazebo or Isaac Sim)

## Getting Started

Begin with the voice-to-action section to understand how robots can process natural language commands.
