# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This interactive textbook covers the essential concepts, tools, and techniques needed to understand and develop intelligent physical systems.

## Overview

This textbook is designed for students and educators learning about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It covers four main modules:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding ROS 2 for robotic control
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation and physics modeling
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception and navigation systems
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Cognitive planning and multimodal AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 for robotic control and communication
- Simulate robots in Gazebo and Unity environments
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac platform for AI perception
- Design humanoid robots for natural interaction
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate through the different modules and chapters. Each module builds upon the previous ones, but you can also explore them independently based on your interests and needs.

## Interactive Features

This textbook includes several interactive features:
- **RAG Chatbot**: Ask questions about any content and get AI-powered answers
- **Code Examples**: Interactive code snippets you can run and modify
- **Simulation Viewers**: Visualize robot behaviors and interactions
- **Exercises**: Practice problems to test your understanding
- **Assessments**: Module-level evaluations to track your progress

## Getting Started

Begin with the first module on ROS 2 to build a solid foundation, or jump to any module that aligns with your current interests and needs.
